# 0x10. HTTPS SSL

The objects of this project are:

- What is HTTPS SSL 2 main roles
- What is the purpose encrypting traffic
- What SSL termination means

## [Task 1](./0-world_wide_web)
- Add the subdomain `www` to your domain, point it to your `lb-01` IP (your domain name might be configured with default subdomains, feel free to remove them)
- Add the subdomain `lb-01` to your domain, point it to your `lb-01` IP
- Add the subdomain `web-01` to your domain, point it to your `web-01` IP
- Add the subdomain `web-02` to your domain, point it to your `web-02` IP
    - Your Bash script must accept 2 arguments:
	- `domain`: type: `string`, what: `domain name to audit`, mandatory: `yes`
	- `subdomain`: type: `string`, what: `specific subdomain to audit`, mandatory: `no`
- Output: The subdomain [SUB_DOMAIN] is a [RECORD_TYPE] record and points to [DESTINATION]
- When only the parameter domain is provided, display information for its subdomains www, lb-01, web-01 and web-02 - in this specific order
- When passing domain and subdomain parameters, display information for the specified subdomain
- Ignore shellcheck case SC2086
	- Must use: `awk`, at least one Bash function
	- You do not need to handle edge cases such as: Empty parameters, Nonexistent domain names and Nonexistent subdomains

## [Task 2](./1-haproxy_ssl_termination)
Create a certificate using `certbot` and configure `HAproxy` to accept encrypted traffic for your subdomain `www..`
#### Requirements:
- HAproxy must be listening on port TCP 443
- HAproxy must be accepting SSL traffic
- HAproxy must serve encrypted traffic that will return the / of your web server
- When querying the root of your domain name, the page returned must contain Holberton School
- Share your HAproxy config as an answer file (`/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg`)
- [certbot](./certbot) installation reference

## [Task 3](./100-redirect_http_to_https)
A good habit is to enforce HTTPS traffic so that no unencrypted traffic is possible. Configure HAproxy to automatically redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
#### Requirements:
- This should be transparent to the user
- HAproxy should return a `301`
- HAproxy should redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS
- Share your HAproxy config as an answer file (`/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg`)
